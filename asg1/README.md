ASSIGNMENT PROJECT 1 WEBSITE
This website is a static front-end website using HTML,CSS and modern web development techniques. The website is a digital portfolio of my skills and achievements. 


DESIGN PROCESS
This website is for future employers who want to know me better by taking a long at my educational history and the skills that I have learnt. 

As recruiters, they would want content to be straightforward and concise, which is why everything is in a single page so that they won't have to wait for different pages to load. I also tried to keep the colour scheme simple.


FEATURES
The navigation bar has buttons that is linked to different sections of the page when clicked. It also follows along as the user scrolls lower so that they won't have to scroll all the way back up if they want to use it again.
All the way to the left side, there is a text logo that says "My Portfolio" which is like a 'Home page' button that brings you back to the top of the page when clicked.

In the next few sections there are sections that are dedicated to a short self intro, skills and achievements, and a contact me form. The contact me form leads to a blank page when clicked.

The footer of the page has different social media icons that lead to social media sites whenever clicked.

Features to be added:
1) Submit button leads to another page that thanks the user for submitting the contact form. May also add requirements for submitting the form using Javascript.
2) A new section that shows pictures of projects that I have done or still working on. Planning to use an image carousel, but may just use static images in a div instead. This new section will have a new navigation button added as well.
