ASSIGNMENT PROJECT 1 WEBSITE
This website is a static front-end website using HTML,CSS and modern web development techniques. The website is a digital portfolio of my skills and achievements. 


DESIGN PROCESS
This website is for future employers who want to know me better by taking a long at my educational history and the skills that I have learnt. When they enter my website, they would want things to be clear and concise, which is why everything is in a single page so that they won't have to wait for different pages to load.

The navigation bar has buttons that lead to different sections of the page when clicked. It also follows along as the user scrolls lower so that they won't have to scroll all the way back up if they want to use it again.
All the way to the left side, there is a text logo that says "My Portfolio" which is like a 'Home page' button that brings you back to the top of the page when clicked.
