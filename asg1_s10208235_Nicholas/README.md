ASSIGNMENT PROJECT 1 WEBSITE
This website is a static front-end website using HTML,CSS and modern web development techniques. The website is a digital portfolio of my skills and achievements. 


DESIGN PROCESS
This website is for future employers who want to know me better by taking a look at my educational history and the skills that I have learnt. 

As recruiters, they would want content to be straightforward and concise, which is why everything is in a single page so that they won't have to wait for different pages to load. I also tried to keep the colour scheme simple.


FEATURES
The navigation bar has buttons that is linked to different sections of the page when clicked. It also follows along as the user scrolls lower so that they won't have to scroll all the way back up if they want to use it again.
All the way to the left side, there is a text logo that says "My Portfolio" which is like a 'Home page' button that brings you back to the top of the page when clicked.

In the next few sections there are sections that are dedicated to a short self intro, skills and achievements, my projects and a contact me form. The contact me form leads to a blank page when clicked. They are all in sections.

The footer of the page has different social media icons that lead to social media sites whenever clicked.

Features to be added:
1) Submit button leads to another page that thanks the user for submitting the contact form. May also add requirements for submitting the form using Javascript.



TECHNOLOGIES USED:
HTML, CSS, GitHub


TESTING
1) Navigation bar:
i. Try clicking on different Navigation bar buttons and verify that the page will scroll to the respective section.
ii. Scroll down the page and verify whether the navigation bar follows as the user scrolls.
iii. Click the home button, while at the bottom of the page and verify that the page scrolls back to the top.

2) Contact Me:
i. When entering information for the contact form, try not filling up all the fields. User should be prompted to fill in the unfilled fields before submitting.

3) Footer
i. Click on the icons and verify that they open a new tab to an external site.

4) Responsiveness
i. Try resizing the browser, the images should change size according to the screen viewport resolution. The text should also collapse into shorter lines.
ii. Once the screen resolution is below 600px(mobile), the text images should adjust according to the stated values in the mystyle.css media query files.
