            ​Hello!  name is Nicholas, I am currently studying Immersive Media at Ngee An Polytechnic. I always had a strong interest in games and IT-related topics,  I pursued Application Development in ITE Higher Nitec and it unexpectedly gave me even more passion to pursue the tech industry. I hope to work in the game industry whether it be a game designer, programmer, or even a narrative writer.
            <br>
            In my free time, my favourite thing to do is to play video games! I play on both the PS4 and PC, and I usually play single player games. 
            <br>
            Since secondary 1, my passion for badminton ignited when I joined the school team, I started training as well as playing leisurely and this is one of the few ways I get to express myself and relieve stress.
